Sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) for Walmart's quarterly earnings reports for after-hours traders.
This study aims to develop a tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analysing Walmart's quarterly earnings reports for after-hours traders. The research evaluated various models, TF-IDF, GloVE, RoBERTa, FinBERT, and ChatGPT, on a dataset spanning from Q1 2019 to Q1 2024, assessing their reliability, performance, and processing time. The results indicate that ChatGPT outperformed other models in terms of accuracy and F1 score but had unsatisfied processing time. Additionally, the research also involved fine-tuning the models using Few-Shot Learning and adjusting the temperature settings. Although fine-tuning improved performance, it increased processing time and sometimes lowered F1 scores. Lowering the temperature enhanced accuracy and F1 score, but at the cost of increased processing time. The study concluded that while fine-tuning and temperature adjustments improved model performance, it introduced trade-offs between accuracy, F1 score, and processing time that must be carefully considered for different applications. The study highlights the potential of NLP for after-hours trading sentiment analysis but also underscores the need for further optimisation to address processing time and real-time applicability limitations.
